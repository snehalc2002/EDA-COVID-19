# EDA-COVID-19
PROJECT OVERVIEW
The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a COVID-19 patient dataset to identify trends related to ICU admissions, vaccination status, oxygen levels, comorbidities, and overall patient health outcomes.

Goals of the Project:

Explore the COVID-19 dataset using Pandas.

Perform feature engineering to derive meaningful insights.

Visualize patient data using advanced plot types (scatter plots, heatmaps, pie charts, etc.).

Summarize key findings related to patient outcomes, vaccination impact, and health risks.

Technologies Used
The following libraries were used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:

NumPy – Numerical computations

Pandas – Data analysis and manipulation

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical visualizations
